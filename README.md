# Quantum-Circuits

This is a repo containing all the findings regarding Quantum Computers for a project report. This repo contains circuit diagrams, csv files, bar charts etc.

## Files Per Experiment

Here is the summary of files per experiment provided in each of their directories.

-   **`Original Circuit`** - This is the circuit diagram of the Quantum Circuit being illustrated in the experiment.
-   **`Res Directory`** - This is directory contains all the necessary technical details regarding the circuit and the Quantum Computer on which the results were computed.
-   **`bar-chart (csv)`** - This file contains all the data for anyone to plot the charts in future.
-   **`bar-chart (img)`** - This is a .png file which is a contains a bar chart reflecting the resutls generated on the IBM Quantum Computers.
-   **`main.py`** - This is python script which contains the code to recreate the same results on a simulator or a Cloud Based Quantum Computer. it is discussed in later sections.
-   **`info (img)`** - This is a .png file containing some other technical info regarding how and the specs of the computer the circuit experiment was performed on.

## Circuits

All the results have been assigned an experiment no. to segregate their content accordingly. This table here gives an overview of the circuit included in each of the experiments.
